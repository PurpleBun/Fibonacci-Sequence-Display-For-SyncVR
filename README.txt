Design Choices
The button that displays the Fibonacci Sequence numbers on the screen is shaped like a big push-button, because it is a stereotypical representation of a button. Everyone knows what to do when they see a big button like this.
I chose this retro font from the Asset Store because the screen reminds me of old projectors.
I wanted to have a sound effect that would match the font of the screen, so I opted for a quick button press sound that reminded me of calculators.
If there was more time, I would have made the numbers 3D-objects instead of 2D digits.
